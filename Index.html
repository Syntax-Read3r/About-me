                        Hello xxxx, my name is Munyaradzi. This is obviously not a common name for most people that I interact. My place of birth is a country located in the southen part of Africa called Zimbabwe.Since you xxx-are||areNot-xx from Zimbabwe, I will tell you a bit about the country for your personal library. The country is one that the sun loves, it's loved soo much to the point where summer is a memory of me spending the day under the shade of a tree since a 5 minute walk away from the shade would risk dehydration. I moved to England with my family, due to political issues I as a child I knew nothing of and am fortunate to have found a <strong>home</strong> in England.

                    <h3>Educational Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's funny that we xx-don't|| actually-xx live in the same city, is not? Forgive my sense of humor as I found it amusing if you did not. I have spend Seven (7) plus years working in the Healthcare industry, where I learnt transferrable skills. A change of pace. During my time in the Healthcare sector, I worked with adolescence, adults and elders would had mental health problems.  As for my eductation background, I went to a Heartsease High School and later attended City College of Norwich to study Sciences. I went into work soon after, as it turn out that my love for science was that only driven by my parents. I gained lifetime skills while in the Science / Healthcare industry such as the ability to perform CPR. An invalueable skill to have, don't you think so XXXX?
